/**
 * This class represents a Response event that is passed from a SipProvider to
 * its SipListener. This specification handles the passing of Response messages 
 * to the application with the event model. An application (SipListener) 
 * registers with the SIP protocol stack (SipProvider) and listens for Response 
 * events from the SipProvider.
 * <p>
 * This specification defines a single Response event object to handle all 
 * Response messages. The Response event encapsulates the Response message 
 * that can be retrieved from {@link javax.sip.ResponseEvent#getResponse()}.
 * Therefore the event type of a Response event can be determined as follows:
 * <p>
 * <i>eventType == ResponseEvent.getResponse().getStatusCode();</i>
 * <p>
 * A Response event also encapsulates the client transaction upon which the
 * Response is correlated, i.e. the client transaction of the Request
 * message upon which this is a Response.
 * <p>
 * ResponseEvent contains the following elements:
 * <ul>
 * <li>source - the source of the event i.e. the SipProvider sending the
 * ResponseEvent.
 * <li>clientTransaction - the client transaction this ResponseEvent is 
 * associated with.
 * <li>Response - the Response message received on the SipProvider
 * that needs passed to the application encapsulated in a ResponseEvent.
 * </ul>
