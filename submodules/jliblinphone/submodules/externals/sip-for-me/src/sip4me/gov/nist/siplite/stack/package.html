This package implements a transaction layer for the SIP stack according
to chapter 17 of RF2543 Bis 09.  To implement transaction stateful
components, you extend the SIPTransactionStack class and not the
SIPStack class.

To create a client transaction you create a transaction aware
MessageChannel for the Hop returned from the router by calling 
Stack.createMessageChannel.

A server transaction is created when an incoming request is fielded by
the stack. It is passed to the application using the SIPServerRequest
and SIPServerResponse interface.
