/**
 * This class represents an Request event that is passed from a SipProvider to
 * its SipListener. This specification handles the passing of request messages to the
 * application use the event model. An application (SipListener) will register
 * with the SIP protocol stack (SipProvider) and listen for Request events
 * from the SipProvider.
 * <p>
 * This specification defines a single Request event object to handle all Request
 * messages. The Request event encapsulates the Request message that can be 
 * retrieved from {@link RequestEvent#getRequest()}. Therefore the event type 
 * of a Request event can be determined as follows:
 * <p>
 * <i>eventType == RequestEvent.getRequest().getMethod();</i>
 * <p>
 * A Request event also encapsulates the server transaction which handles the
 * Request.
 * <p>
 * RequestEvent contains the following elements:
 * <ul>
 * <li>source - the source of the event i.e. the SipProvider sending the
 * RequestEvent
 * <li>serverTransaction - the server transaction this RequestEvent is 
 * associated with.
 * <li>Request - the Request message received on the SipProvider
 * that needs passed to the application encapsulated in a RequestEvent.
 * </ul>
