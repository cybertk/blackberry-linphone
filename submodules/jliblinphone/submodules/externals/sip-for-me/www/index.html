	<p>A Public Domain SIP Signaling stack that works under J2ME/MIDP 2.0 and
	implements the JSR 180.</p> 
    <p>This project uses a scaled down version of JAIN-SIP ported to J2ME by the NIST.</p>

	<p>Currently, this project is proudly sponsored and maintained by <a href="http://www.genaker.net">Genaker</a>.</p>
    <p>Thanks to their contribution, the stack has been fixed, adapted and thoroughly tested to work on real devices and against many SIP and IMS deployments.</p>
